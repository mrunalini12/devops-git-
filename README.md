# DevOps Git Project

## Summary
This project demonstrates the use of Git for version control in a DevOps environment. The key operations covered include:

- Creating branches (`master`, `dev`, `feature`)
- Performing merges and pull requests
- Using `.gitignore` to manage files that should not be tracked by Git
- Committing and pushing changes to GitHub
